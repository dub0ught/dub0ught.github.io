        Today, I embarked on creating my own website! This blog post is first of what I hope to be a daily occurrence. The reason for beginning this blog comes from motivation to crawl (quite slowly) out of a deep depression from the last 2 days, which I'll talk about later.</p>
        
        Firstly, I'd like to talk about motivation, the catalyst at play here, and my relationship with it. I'm what you would call a manic depressive; my mood swings from the highest of the highs to the lowest of the lows at varying lengths of time. I can count on my hands the amount of times I've felt truly mentally stable, meaning content without extreme fluctuations in my mood. Along with my mood is my ability to utilize motivation. Even if a Goggins type pushed me over the edge, unless my mind is in the right place to accept it, it likely won't happen. It's hard to motivate someone who has no energy to act.</p>

        Now, motivation is not just tied to initialization. It directly affects my ability to persist, as well. For this blog, for example, I may feel highly motivated right now to take action, write all of this out, explain the mechanisms within me and get a move on to developing it further. That's great and all, but if I'm to make this an everyday function, who's to say the drive will exist tomorrow? Coupled with a fluctuating mood, with some shame sprinkled in and an inferiority complex to top it all off, you're destined to fail time and time again.</p>
        
        When my mood ticks positive, motivation is like a drug that I can't get enough of. I think I could conquer the fucking universe in a day when I'm feeling chipper. The world doesn't seem like such a daunting place to be, and the modern stresses we are cornered by on a daily basis appear resistable.</p>
        
        When I'm down, motivation acts as a source of shame and defeat. It's like having a bar of gold sitting right in front of you, ready for the taking, but your arm is too weak to hold it, your fingers are limp and chewed to the bone and the sinews of your tendons are dry and cracked. You feel that any movement you make will cause you to collapse, and you avoid seizing the opportunity for greatness out of self-preservation.
